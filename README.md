# IPA_identification
Steps for identifying potential Important Plant Areas (IPA).

This github repository is based on the analysis undertaken to identify potential IPAs for useful plants in Colombia. This used existing occurrence records and applied IPA Criteria A and B. While there are many ways to approach IPA identification, we hope that this will prove useful for application in other countries and regions. 

We have split the analysis for each criterion into three workbooks corresponding to: 1. downloading and cleaning data from GBIF and BIEN, 2. analysing data against IPA thresholds, 3. mapping. In each workbook, we have simplified our code to summarise the steps taken and functions used. You can replace "path/to/data.csv", etc. with the actual file paths in your own system.

*Background*

The IPA programme was established in 2002 to identify and protect a network of best sites for plant conservation in the world. These are identified according to [globally consistent criteria](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10531-017-1336-6) based on the presence of A. threatened species, B. botanical richness and C. threatened habitats, usually identified at the national level.
